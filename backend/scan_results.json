A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.",

                            "Description": "ImageMagick is an open source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to version 1.21.0, a crafted HEIF that exercises the overlay image item path triggers a heap buffer over-read in `HeifPixelImage::overlay()`. The function computes a negative row length (likely from an unclipped overlay rectangle or invalid offsets), which then underflows when converted to `size_t` and is passed to `memcpy`, causing a very large read past the end of the source plane and a crash. Version 1.21.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, avoid decoding images using `iovl` overlay boxes.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.",

                            "Description": "ImageMagick is an open source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.",

                            "Description": "ImageMagick is an open source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

                            "Description": "ImageMagick is an open source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

                            "Description": "ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32.",

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.

                            "Description": "NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.24.1 is vulnerable to possible domain hijack attacks. Promiscuous NS RRSets that complement positive DNS replies in the authority section can be used to trick resolvers to update their delegation information for the zone. Usually these RRSets are used to update the resolver's knowledge of the zone's name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point. Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible poison effect. Unbound 1.24.2 includes an additional fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from YXDOMAIN and non-referral nodata replies, further mitigating the possible poison effect.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

The file has the object as it's private_data and holds\na users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as\nthe file is.\n\nWhen the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it\nwill fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This\ncauses a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to\ndecrement the users refcount.\n\nFix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call\n__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before\nkfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object\nimplementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file\npointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.\n\nIf the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users\nrefcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.\n\nIt is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an\nissue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().\n\nThe UAF looks like this:\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n    Write of size 4 at addr ffff888059c97804 by task syz.0.46/6164\n\n    CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6164 Comm: syz.0.46 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\n    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n     print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:378 [inline]\n     print_report+0xcd/0x630 mm/kasan/report.c:482\n     kasan_report+0xe0/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:595\n     check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]\n     kasan_check_range+0x100/0x1b0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189\n     instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:96 [inline]\n     atomic_fetch_sub_release include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h:400 [inline]\n     __refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:455 [inline]\n     refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:476 [inline]\n     iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n     __fput+0x402/0xb70 fs/file_table.c:468\n     task_work_run+0x14d/0x240 kernel/task_work.c:227\n     resume_user_mode_work include/linux/resume_user_mode.h:50 [inline]\n     exit_to_user_mode_loop+0xeb/0x110 kernel/entry/common.c:43\n     exit_to_user_mode_prepare include/linux/irq-entry-common.h:225 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work include/linux/entry-common.h:175 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode include/linux/entry-common.h:210 [inline]\n     do_syscall_64+0x41c/0x4c0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:100\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f",

Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant is safe here.\n\nThis bug was initially identified through static analysis.\n\n[hverkuil: fix typo in Subject: tunner -> tuner]",

The value 0x00 is\nreserved for undefined ID,\n```\n\nIf we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked\nas UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.\n\nIn a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb (\"media: uvcvideo: Require\nentities to have a non-zero unique ID\"), we ignored all the invalid units,\nthis broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky\nthis time.\n\nThis also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due\nto a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an\nOutput Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But\nwhen looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is\nfound instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.\n\nIn another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID\nwas 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.\n\nHere is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.\n\n[   20.650953] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using dummy_hcd\n[   20.830206] usb 1-1: Using ep0 maxpacket: 8\n[   20.833501] usb 1-1: config 0 descriptor??\n[   21.038518] usb 1-1: string descriptor 0 read error: -71\n[   21.038893] usb 1-1: Found UVC 0.00 device <unnamed> (2833:0201)\n[   21.039299] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Output 1 was not initialized!\n[   21.041583] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Input 1 was not initialized!\n[   21.042218] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   21.042536] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at drivers/media/mc/mc-entity.c:1147 media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.043195] Modules linked in:\n[   21.043535] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 9 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7-00030-g3480e43aeccf #444\n[   21.044101] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[   21.044639] Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\n[   21.045100] RIP: 0010:media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.045508] Code: fe e8 20 01 00 00 b8 f4 ff ff ff 48 83 c4 30 5b 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 5f 5d c3 cc cc cc cc 0f 0b eb e9 0f 0b eb 0a 0f 0b eb 06 <0f> 0b eb 02 0f 0b b8 ea ff ff ff eb d4 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00\n[   21.046801] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000004b318 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[   21.047227] RAX: ffff888004e5d458 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: ffffffff818fccf1\n[   21.047719] RDX: 000000000000007b RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff888004313290\n[   21.048241] RBP: ffff888004313290 R08: 0001ffffffffffff R09: 0000000000000000\n[   21.048701] R10: 0000000000000013 R11: 0001888004313290 R12: 0000000000000003\n[   21.049138] R13: ffff888004313080 R14: ffff888004313080 R15: 0000000000000000\n[   21.049648] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88803ec00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[   21.050271] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[   21.050688] CR2: 0000592cc27635b0 CR3: 000000000431c000 CR4: 0000000000750ef0\n[   21.051136] PKRU: 55555554\n[   21.051331] Call Trace:\n[   21.051480]  <TASK>\n[   21.051611]  ? __warn+0xc4/0x210\n[   21.051861]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.052252]  ? report_bug+0x11b/0x1a0\n[   21.052540]  ? trace_hardirqs_on+0x31/0x40\n[   21.052901]  ? handle_bug+0x3d/0x70\n[   21.053197]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x50\n[   21.053511]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[   21.053924]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x91/0x2e0\n[   21.054364]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0\n[   21.054834]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x91/0x2e0\n[   21.055131]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1e/0x40\n[   21.055441]  ? __v4l2_device_register_subdev+0x202/0x210\n[   21.055837]  uvc_mc_register_entities+0x358/0x400\n[   21.056144]  uvc_register_chains+0x1\n---truncated---",

Possibly there were no users at that time, or the test cases were\ninsufficient to hit it.\n\nThe bug was then only noticed and fixed after\ncommit 9c2ba265352a (\"drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies v2\")\nlanded, with its fixup of\ncommit 4eaf02d6076c (\"drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies\").\n\nAt that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which\ncommit 963d0b356935 (\"drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder\")\nnoticed and attempted to fix.\n\nBut it only moved the double free from happening inside the\ndrm_sched_job_add_dependency(), when releasing the reference not yet\nobtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference already released by\nthe former in the failure case.\n\nAs such it is not easy to identify the right target for the fixes tag so\nlets keep it simple and just continue the chain.\n\nWhile fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking\nthe reference and not dropping it.",

The cause of this is the mask is set\ntoo wide, so the page_pool_page_is_pp() incurs false positives which\ncrashes the machine.\n\nJust disabling the check in page_pool_is_pp() will lead to the page_pool\ncode itself malfunctioning; so instead of doing this, this patch changes\nthe define for PP_DMA_INDEX_BITS to avoid mistaking arbitrary kernel\npointers for page_pool-tagged pages.\n\nThe fix relies on the kernel pointers that alias with the pp_magic field\nalways being above PAGE_OFFSET. With this assumption, we can use the\nlowest bit of the value of PAGE_OFFSET as the upper bound of the\nPP_DMA_INDEX_MASK, which should avoid the false positives.\n\nBecause we cannot rely on PAGE_OFFSET always being a compile-time\nconstant, nor on it always being >0, we fall back to disabling the\ndma_index storage when there are not enough bits available. This leaves\nus in the situation we were in before the patch in the Fixes tag, but\nonly on a subset of architecture configurations. This seems to be the\nbest we can do until the transition to page types in complete for\npage_pool pages.\n\nv2:\n- Make sure there's at least 8 bits available and that the PAGE_OFFSET\n  bit calculation doesn't wrap",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\n\nThe ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various\nlists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback\nis destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm: destroy xfrm_state\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\n\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked.",

So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?\nThe commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:\n\n\"By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty\nmuch guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt\ncontext (during I/O completion).\n\nAha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.\nThe completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse\nserver to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the\nstruct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the\nfuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,\nwhich in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.\n\nSending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads\nis a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous\nAIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and\nnow there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.\n\nFix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave\na comment explaining why.",

This results in a permanently elevated\n   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.\n\n2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket\n   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap\n   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.\n\n3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a\n   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for\n   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a\n   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.\n\nDo not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected\nsockets: they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by\nsendmsg().\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/e07fd95c-9a38-4eea-9638-133e38c2ec9b@rbox.co/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250317-vsock-trans-signal-race-v4-0-fc8837f3f1d4@rbox.co/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/60f1b7db-3099-4f6a-875e-af9f6ef194f6@rbox.co/",

So the best option would be just to return an error at\nthe parameter setup time before doing any further operations.\n\nThis patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when\nthe packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with\nep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or\ngreater than ep->packsize[0].",

It is\ndue to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being\ndeleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been\ntoggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we\nhave MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN\nfiltering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't\nhappen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled\nbecause we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop\nlearning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is\ninitialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port\nstate bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead\nin the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=dd280197f0f7ab3917be",

This is problematic since\nonly user CQs created through the mlx5_ib driver are intended to use\nthis function.\n\nAdditionally, all CQs that will use doorbells instead of polling for\ncompletions must call mlx5_cq_arm. However, the default CQ creation flow\nleaves a valid value in the CQ's arm_db field, allowing FW to send\ninterrupts to polling-only CQs in certain corner cases.\n\nThese two factors would allow a polling-only kernel CQ to be triggered\nby an EQ interrupt and call a completion function intended only for user\nCQs, causing a null pointer exception.\n\nSome areas in the driver have prevented this issue with one-off fixes\nbut did not address the root cause.\n\nThis patch fixes the described issue by adding defaults to the create CQ\nflow. It adds a default dummy completion function to protect against\nnull pointer exceptions, and it sets an invalid command sequence number\nby default in kernel CQs to prevent the FW from sending an interrupt to\nthe CQ until it is armed. User CQs are responsible for their own\ninitialization values.\n\nCallers of mlx5_core_create_cq are responsible for changing the\ncompletion function and arming the CQ per their needs.",

This becomes highly inefficient when scanning\nlarge virtual memory areas that contain mostly unmapped regions, causing\nksmd to use large amount of cpu without deduplicating much pages.\n\nThis patch replaces the per-address lookup with a range walk using\nwalk_page_range().  The range walker allows KSM to skip over entire\nunmapped holes in a VMA, avoiding unnecessary lookups.  This problem was\npreviously discussed in [1].\n\nConsider the following test program which creates a 32 TiB mapping in the\nvirtual address space but only populates a single page:\n\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <sys/mman.h>\n\n/* 32 TiB */\nconst size_t size = 32ul * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;\n\nint main() {\n        char *area = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,\n                          MAP_NORESERVE | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON, -1, 0);\n\n        if (area == MAP_FAILED) {\n                perror(\"mmap() failed\\n\");\n                return -1;\n        }\n\n        /* Populate a single page such that we get an anon_vma. */\n        *area = 0;\n\n        /* Enable KSM. */\n        madvise(area, size, MADV_MERGEABLE);\n        pause();\n        return 0;\n}\n\n$ ./ksm-sparse  &\n$ echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run \n\nWithout this patch ksmd uses 100% of the cpu for a long time (more then 1\nhour in my test machine) scanning all the 32 TiB virtual address space\nthat contain only one mapped page.  This makes ksmd essentially deadlocked\nnot able to deduplicate anything of value.  With this patch ksmd walks\nonly the one mapped page and skips the rest of the 32 TiB virtual address\nspace, making the scan fast using little cpu.",

The root cause is\nan access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.\nSpecifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function\nis called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the\nsg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been\nfreed.\n\nThe SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()\nin uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.\nWithin the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,\ndata_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may\noccur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result\nin URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully\nsubmitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV\nerror code in this case. The current error handling directly calls\nscsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()\nto invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully\nsubmitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call\nusb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg\nunmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.\n\nThis patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()\nfunction. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already\nbeen successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking\nscsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully\nsubmitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then\nthe scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after\nall pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()\nfunction will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nThe error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls\nuas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,\nthe device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),\nwhere uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().",

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)",

Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.

This results in the\nbelow warning:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 349 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1929 free_irq+0x278/0x29c\nCall trace:\n free_irq+0x278/0x29c\n ath11k_pcic_free_irq+0x70/0x10c [ath11k]\n ath11k_pci_probe+0x800/0x820 [ath11k_pci]\n local_pci_probe+0x40/0xbc\n\nThe warning is due to not clearing the affinity hint before freeing the\nIRQs.\n\nSo to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling\nath11k_pcic_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once\nagain further down the error path due to code organization, but that does\nno harm.\n\nTested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-05266-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1",

In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",

Use that flag at\nk3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn() to deicide if the FDQ needs\nto be cleared for every flow or just for flow 0.\n\nFixes the below issue on ti_am65_cpsw_nuss driver on AM62-SK.\n\n> ip link set eth1 down\n> ip link set eth0 down\n> ethtool -L eth0 rx 8\n> ip link set eth0 up\n> modprobe -r ti_am65_cpsw_nuss\n\n[  103.045726] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  103.050505] k3_knav_desc_pool size 512000 != avail 64000\n[  103.050703] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 450 at drivers/net/ethernet/ti/k3-cppi-desc-pool.c:33 k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.068810] Modules linked in: ti_am65_cpsw_nuss(-) k3_cppi_desc_pool snd_soc_hdmi_codec crct10dif_ce snd_soc_simple_card snd_soc_simple_card_utils display_connector rtc_ti_k3 k3_j72xx_bandgap tidss drm_client_lib snd_soc_davinci_mcas\np drm_dma_helper tps6598x phylink snd_soc_ti_udma rti_wdt drm_display_helper snd_soc_tlv320aic3x_i2c typec at24 phy_gmii_sel snd_soc_ti_edma snd_soc_tlv320aic3x sii902x snd_soc_ti_sdma sa2ul omap_mailbox drm_kms_helper authenc cfg80211 r\nfkill fuse drm drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight ip_tables x_tables ipv6 [last unloaded: k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.119950] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 450 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.13.0-rc7-00001-g9c5e3435fa66 #1011\n[  103.119968] Hardware name: Texas Instruments AM625 SK (DT)\n[  103.119974] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  103.119983] pc : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.148007] lr : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.154709] sp : ffff8000826ebbc0\n[  103.158015] x29: ffff8000826ebbc0 x28: ffff0000090b6300 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  103.165145] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24: ffff0000019df6b0\n[  103.172271] x23: ffff0000019df6b8 x22: ffff0000019df410 x21: ffff8000826ebc88\n[  103.179397] x20: 000000000007d000 x19: ffff00000a3b3000 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  103.186522] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 000001e8c35e1cde\n[  103.193647] x14: 0000000000000396 x13: 000000000000035c x12: 0000000000000000\n[  103.200772] x11: 000000000000003a x10: 00000000000009c0 x9 : ffff8000826eba20\n[  103.207897] x8 : ffff0000090b6d20 x7 : ffff00007728c180 x6 : ffff00007728c100\n[  103.215022] x5 : 0000000000000001 x4 : ffff000000508a50 x3 : ffff7ffff6146000\n[  103.222147] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : e300b4173ee6b200 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  103.229274] Call trace:\n[  103.231714]  k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool] (P)\n[  103.238408]  am65_cpsw_nuss_free_rx_chns+0x28/0x4c [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.244942]  devm_action_release+0x14/0x20\n[  103.249040]  release_nodes+0x3c/0x68\n[  103.252610]  devres_release_all+0x8c/0xdc\n[  103.256614]  device_unbind_cleanup+0x18/0x60\n[  103.260876]  device_release_driver_internal+0xf8/0x178\n[  103.266004]  driver_detach+0x50/0x9c\n[  103.269571]  bus_remove_driver+0x6c/0xbc\n[  103.273485]  driver_unregister+0x30/0x60\n[  103.277401]  platform_driver_unregister+0x14/0x20\n[  103.282096]  am65_cpsw_nuss_driver_exit+0x18/0xff4 [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.288620]  __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x17c/0x25c\n[  103.293404]  invoke_syscall+0x44/0x100\n[  103.297149]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xc0/0xe0\n[  103.301845]  do_el0_svc+0x1c/0x28\n[  103.305155]  el0_svc+0x28/0x98\n---truncated---",

This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma\n\nPatch series \"Fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma\".\n\n\nThis patch (of 4):\n\nWe encountered a BUG alert triggered by Syzkaller as follows:\n   BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:00000000b4a60fca type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1\n\nAnd we can reproduce it with the following steps:\n1. register uprobe on file at zero offset\n2. mmap the file at zero offset:\n   addr1 = mmap(NULL, 2 * 4096, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);\n3. mremap part of vma1 to new vma2:\n   addr2 = mremap(addr1, 4096, 2 * 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE);\n4. mremap back to orig addr1:\n   mremap(addr2, 4096, 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE | MREMAP_FIXED, addr1);\n\nIn step 3, the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096] will be remap to new vma2\nwith range [addr2, addr2 + 8192], and remap uprobe anon page from the vma1\nto vma2, then unmap the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].\n\nIn step 4, the vma2 range [addr2, addr2 + 4096] will be remap back to the\naddr range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].  Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,\naddr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to\nexpand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the\nmerged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to\nthe merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use\nset_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite\nthe newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.\n\nSince the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the\nunnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.\n\nThis problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the\ncommunity syzkaller:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ada39605a5e71711@google.com/T/",

If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-> kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

This access is\ndetected as a narrower read in bpf_skb_is_valid_access because it\ndoesn't match offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk). It is therefore allowed\nand later proceeds to bpf_convert_ctx_access. Note that for the\n\"is_narrower_load\" case in the convert_ctx_accesses(), the insn->off\nis aligned, so the cnt may not be 0 because it matches the\noffsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk) in the bpf_convert_ctx_access. However,\nthe target_size stays 0 and the verifier errors with a kernel warning:\n\n    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion(1)\n\nThis patch fixes that to return a proper \"invalid bpf_context access\noff=X size=Y\" error on the load instruction.\n\nThe same issue affects multiple other fields in context structures that\nallow narrow access. Some other non-affected fields (for sk_msg,\nsk_lookup, and sockopt) were also changed to use bpf_ctx_range_ptr for\nconsistency.\n\nNote this syzkaller crash was reported in the \"Closes\" link below, which\nused to be about a different bug, fixed in\ncommit fce7bd8e385a (\"bpf/verifier: Handle BPF_LOAD_ACQ instructions\nin insn_def_regno()\"). Because syzbot somehow confused the two bugs,\nthe new crash and repro didn't get reported to the mailing list.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",

To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and\nGFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate\nmemalloc scope.\n\nxfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.\n\nThere was a report here\nhttps://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com\n\nThis patch:\n - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;\n - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();\n - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()\n   around apply_to_page_range();\n - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames\n\nThe ice_put_rx_mbuf() function handles calling ice_put_rx_buf() for each\nbuffer in the current frame. This function was introduced as part of\nhandling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.\n\nIt works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the\ntotal number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program\nwas executed.\n\nIf the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in\nice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added\nas fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a\nfragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't\ncall ice_put_rx_buf().\n\nBecause we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the\npage or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't\nincrement next_to_alloc.\n\nThe ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented\nproperly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since\nthis function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top\nof the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.\n\nNote that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The\nice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a\nsingle-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear\nprecisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,\nbut it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.\n\nTo fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on\nall buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a\nsimilar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic\nalso in ice_get_pgcnts().\n\nInstead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which\niterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just\npast the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does\ncall ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of\npacket.\n\nFor non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting\nthe pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of\nthe frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only\nupdate the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still\nremaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for\nfragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.\n\nThe xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and\nonly once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from\nice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function\ndirectly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra\nbit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.\n\nMove the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*\nall calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic\nrequires the index of the element just after the current frame.\n\nNow that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no\nlonger need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring.",

In both cases zpci_register_ioat()\nfails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. This\nis because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the\nhypervisor is concerned.\n\nCurrently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()\nfails. This triggers the WARN_ON() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()\nbecause attaching to the default domain must never fail.\n\nWith the device fenced by the hypervisor no DMAs to or from memory are\npossible and the IOMMU translations have no effect. Proceed as if the\nregistration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up\nthe device.\n\nThis is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since\ncommit 59bbf596791b (\"iommu/s390: Make attach succeed even if the device\nis in error state\") except that for removal the domain will not be\nregistered later.

This setup causes the following mishap during the &=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n& operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]",

This validation only\nvalidates the skb->len (directly reflects size provided at the\nuserspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer\nitself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing\nof memory content at the address assuming the correct layout\nper what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to\nbuffer of `skb_buff->data` which is not assigned anything yet.\n\nFollowing the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at\n`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective\nhandlers and return error values in case of failure. Release\nthe skb if error values are returned from handlers in\n`nci_nft_packet` and effectively do a silent drop\n\nPossible TODO: because we silently drop the packets, the\ncall to `nci_request` will be waiting for completion of request\nand will face timeouts. These timeouts can get excessively logged\nin the dmesg. A proper handling of them may require to export\n`nci_request_cancel` (or propagate error handling from the\nnft packets handlers).",

If the mask bit gets changed\nby the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,\nthe mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the\nuser-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.\n\nFor eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,\nthe host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.\nHowever, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a\nmessage in the inbound ring buffer. So let’s assume that happens,\nthe host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.\n\nSubsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring\nbuffer interrupt mask to 0, saying “Hey, I’m ready for interrupts”.\nUser space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.\nThen one of two things happens:\n\n* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.\n* The host does send another message. But because there’s already a\n  message in the ring buffer, it doesn’t generate an interrupt.\n  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an\n  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to\n  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not\n  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.\n  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from\n  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.\n\nThis could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay\nsetting interrupt mask to 0.\n\nSimilarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,\nthere’s a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring\nbuffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could\nput another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn’t interrupt.\nThen the next pread() would hang.\n\nFix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,\nwhile keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace\ncontrol the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.",

This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.",

However\nthis expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in\nthe current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have\nnot added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do\nnot have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.\n\nThe insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree\nhappens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper\ninsert_block_group_item().

Various\ndrivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio\ncould easily negotiate mailbox API.\n\nThis convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.\nCommit 0062e7cc955e (\"ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code\") added support\nfor IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the\nrest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of\nsupport was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such\ncode paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was\nintroduced along with introduction of the feature itself.\n\nCommit 339f28964147 (\"ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication\nbetween PF and VF\") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it\nintroduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API\nversion for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version\ndefined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,\nas the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe\ndriver as it causes crashes.\n\nThe issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit\nd0725312adf5 (\"ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5\").\nAs a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API\nto version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.\n\nTo fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported\nfeatures. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF & VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future.",

If such dentry is a directory,\nexportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the\ndentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons\n(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to\nlookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we\nare trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the\nparent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the\nparent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this\ninconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point\nto the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in\ndisconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until\ncommit f1ee616214cb (\"VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon\")\nwhich removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb->s_anon list.\nThus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely\nrelies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.\nHowever when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the\nscenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries\nare \"leaked\". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise\nthey stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous \"Busy\ninodes after unmount\" bug.

However, if the network interface was\nnot previously enabled, the `priv->wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and\ninitialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.\n\nTo fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue\nfrom the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.\nThis ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is\nused during device resume. And added logic to destroy the workqueue\nin the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the\n`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks.",

The program returns struct xdp_md's\negress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned\nexpected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA\ncalls.\n\nThe underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs\nof type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well\nas sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'\nexpected_attach_type. Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME\nshould not be allowed doing a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind()\nout of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.\n\nIn short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional\nfunctionality or restrictions beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables.\nThe use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints. Fix it by enforcing\nexpected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().\n\nNote that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or\ncpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and\ncpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment / context and therefore\nthese situations are not prone to this issue.",

However, the\nACPI spec doesn't provide a way to enumerate the memory type of\nSystemMemory regions, i.e. there's no way to tell software that a region\nmust be mapped as UC vs. WB, etc.  As a result, Linux's ACPI driver always\nmaps SystemMemory regions using ioremap_cache(), i.e. as WB on x86.\n\nThe dedicated device drivers however, e.g. the HPET driver and TPM driver,\nwant to map their associated memory as UC or WC, as accessing PCI devices\nusing WB is unsupported.\n\nOn bare metal and non-CoCO, the conflicting requirements \"work\" as firmware\nconfigures the PCI hole (and other device memory) to be UC in the MTRRs.\nSo even though the ACPI mappings request WB, they are forced to UC- in the\nkernel's tracking due to the kernel properly handling the MTRR overrides,\nand thus are compatible with the drivers' requested WC/UC-.\n\nWith force WB MTRRs on SNP and TDX guests, the ACPI mappings get their\nrequested WB if the ACPI mappings are established before the dedicated\ndriver code attempts to initialize the device.  E.g. if acpi_init()\nruns before the corresponding device driver is probed, ACPI's WB mapping\nwill \"win\", and result in the driver's ioremap() failing because the\nexisting WB mapping isn't compatible with the requested WC/UC-.\n\nE.g. when a TPM is emulated by the hypervisor (ignoring the security\nimplications of relying on what is allegedly an untrusted entity to store\nmeasurements), the TPM driver will request UC and fail:\n\n  [  1.730459] ioremap error for 0xfed40000-0xfed45000, requested 0x2, got 0x0\n  [  1.732780] tpm_tis MSFT0101:00: probe with driver tpm_tis failed with error -12\n\nNote, the '0x2' and '0x0' values refer to \"enum page_cache_mode\", not x86's\nmemtypes (which frustratingly are an almost pure inversion; 2 == WB, 0 == UC).\nE.g. tracing mapping requests for TPM TIS yields:\n\n Mapping TPM TIS with req_type = 0\n WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 1 at arch/x86/mm/pat/memtype.c:530 memtype_reserve+0x2ab/0x460\n Modules linked in:\n CPU: 22 UID: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G        W           6.16.0-rc7+ #2 VOLUNTARY\n Tainted: [W]=WARN\n Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/29/2025\n RIP: 0010:memtype_reserve+0x2ab/0x460\n  __ioremap_caller+0x16d/0x3d0\n  ioremap_cache+0x17/0x30\n  x86_acpi_os_ioremap+0xe/0x20\n  acpi_os_map_iomem+0x1f3/0x240\n  acpi_os_map_memory+0xe/0x20\n  acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler+0x273/0x440\n  acpi_ev_address_space_dispatch+0x176/0x4c0\n  acpi_ex_access_region+0x2ad/0x530\n  acpi_ex_field_datum_io+0xa2/0x4f0\n  acpi_ex_extract_from_field+0x296/0x3e0\n  acpi_ex_read_data_from_field+0xd1/0x460\n  acpi_ex_resolve_node_to_value+0x2ee/0x530\n  acpi_ex_resolve_to_value+0x1f2/0x540\n  acpi_ds_evaluate_name_path+0x11b/0x190\n  acpi_ds_exec_end_op+0x456/0x960\n  acpi_ps_parse_loop+0x27a/0xa50\n  acpi_ps_parse_aml+0x226/0x600\n  acpi_ps_execute_method+0x172/0x3e0\n  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x175/0x5f0\n  acpi_evaluate_object+0x213/0x490\n  acpi_evaluate_integer+0x6d/0x140\n  acpi_bus_get_status+0x93/0x150\n  acpi_add_single_object+0x43a/0x7c0\n  acpi_bus_check_add+0x149/0x3a0\n  acpi_bus_check_add_1+0x16/0x30\n  acpi_ns_walk_namespace+0x22c/0x360\n  acpi_walk_namespace+0x15c/0x170\n  acpi_bus_scan+0x1dd/0x200\n  acpi_scan_init+0xe5/0x2b0\n  acpi_init+0x264/0x5b0\n  do_one_i\n---truncated---",

This causes a\nmemory leak because the caller unconditionally sets the pointer to NULL\nafter the call, preventing any cleanup.\n\nThe issue occurs because the level validation check happens before the\nmutex is acquired and before any error handling path that would free\nthe prealloc pointer. On this early return, the cleanup code at the\n'out' label (which includes kfree(prealloc)) is never reached.\n\nIn btrfs_ioctl_qgroup_assign(), the code pattern is:\n\n    prealloc = kzalloc(sizeof(*prealloc), GFP_KERNEL);\n    ret = btrfs_add_qgroup_relation(trans, sa->src, sa->dst, prealloc);\n    prealloc = NULL;  // Always set to NULL regardless of return value\n    ...\n    kfree(prealloc);  // This becomes kfree(NULL), does nothing\n\nWhen the level check fails, 'prealloc' is never freed by either the\ncallee or the caller, resulting in a 64-byte memory leak per failed\noperation. This can be triggered repeatedly by an unprivileged user\nwith access to a writable btrfs mount, potentially exhausting kernel\nmemory.\n\nFix this by freeing prealloc before the early return, ensuring prealloc\nis always freed on all error paths.",

No such locking was ever added\nin sriov_disable() however. In particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc\n(\"PCI/IOV: Factor out sriov_add_vfs()\") factored out the PCI device\nremoval into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the\npci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.\n\nOn s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double\nremove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed:\n\n  PSW:  0704c00180000000 0000000c914e4b38 (klist_put+56)\n  GPRS: 000003800313fb48 0000000000000000 0000000100000001 0000000000000001\n\t00000000f9b520a8 0000000000000000 0000000000002fbd 00000000f4cc9480\n\t0000000000000001 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000180692828\n\t00000000818e8000 000003800313fe2c 000003800313fb20 000003800313fad8\n  #0 [3800313fb20] device_del at c9158ad5c\n  #1 [3800313fb88] pci_remove_bus_device at c915105ba\n  #2 [3800313fbd0] pci_iov_remove_virtfn at c9152f198\n  #3 [3800313fc28] zpci_iov_remove_virtfn at c90fb67c0\n  #4 [3800313fc60] zpci_bus_remove_device at c90fb6104\n  #5 [3800313fca0] __zpci_event_availability at c90fb3dca\n  #6 [3800313fd08] chsc_process_sei_nt0 at c918fe4a2\n  #7 [3800313fd60] crw_collect_info at c91905822\n  #8 [3800313fe10] kthread at c90feb390\n  #9 [3800313fe68] __ret_from_fork at c90f6aa64\n  #10 [3800313fe98] ret_from_fork at c9194f3f2.\n\nThis is because in addition to sriov_disable() removing the VFs, the\nplatform also generates hot-unplug events for the VFs. This being the\nreverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and\nhandled via pdev->no_vf_scan. And while the event processing takes\npci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,\nthe lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.\n\nOther races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of\nlocking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. Even on s390 the\nlist corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform\nevents are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long\nas the removal finished synchronously they would not race. Either way the\nlocking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.\n\nJust like PCI rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()\nincluding for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is\ncalled without the PCI rescan-remove lock being held. Even in the non-error\ncase, adding new PCI devices and buses should be serialized via the PCI\nrescan-remove lock. Add the necessary locking.",

The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead\nof panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an\nin-userspace #MC.\n\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff8372f8bc> {memchr_inv+0x4c/0xf0}\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC afff7bbff88a ADDR 1d301b000 MISC 80 PPIN 1e741e77539027db\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:d06d0 TIME 1758093249 SOCKET 0 APIC 0 microcode 80000320\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check\n\nThe root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered\nby an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting\nprocess employs a mechanism, implemented in\ntry_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to\nidentify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results\nin a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()\ncompletes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.  See the kernel panic\ncall trace on the two #MCs.\n\n  First Machine Check occurs // [1]\n    memory_failure()         // [2]\n      try_to_split_thp_page()\n        split_huge_page()\n          split_huge_page_to_list_to_order()\n            __folio_split()  // [3]\n              remap_page()\n                remove_migration_ptes()\n                  remove_migration_pte()\n                    try_to_map_unused_to_zeropage()  // [4]\n                      memchr_inv()                   // [5]\n                        Second Machine Check occurs  // [6]\n                          Kernel panic\n\n[1] Triggered by accessing a hardware-poisoned THP in userspace, which is\n    typically recoverable by terminating the affected process.\n\n[2] Call folio_set_has_hwpoisoned() before try_to_split_thp_page().\n\n[3] Pass the RMP_USE_SHARED_ZEROPAGE remap flag to remap_page().\n\n[4] Try to map the unused THP to zeropage.\n\n[5] Re-access pages in the hw-poisoned THP in the kernel.\n\n[6] Triggered in-kernel, leading to a panic kernel.\n\nIn Step[2], memory_failure() sets the poisoned flag on the page in the THP\nby TestSetPageHWPoison() before calling try_to_split_thp_page().\n\nAs suggested by David Hildenbrand, fix this panic by not accessing to the\npoisoned page in the THP during zeropage identification, while continuing\nto scan unaffected pages in the THP for possible zeropage mapping.  This\nprevents a second in-kernel #MC that would cause kernel panic in Step[4].\n\nThanks to Andrew Zaborowski for his initial work on fixing this issue.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: openvswitch: remove never-working support for setting nsh fields\n\nThe validation of the set(nsh(...)) action is completely wrong.\nIt runs through the nsh_key_put_from_nlattr() function that is the\nsame function that validates NSH keys for the flow match and the\npush_nsh() action.  However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different\nmemory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in\ncase of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.\n\nThere is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that\nsays that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both\nthe value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value\nwe're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to\nwrite into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during\nvalidation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 1c2383067 P4D 1c2383067 PUD 20b703067 PMD 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 8 UID: 0 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.17.0-rc4+ #107 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  RIP: 0010:nsh_key_put_from_nlattr+0x19d/0x610 [openvswitch]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   validate_nsh+0x60/0x90 [openvswitch]\n   validate_set.constprop.0+0x270/0x3c0 [openvswitch]\n   __ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x477/0x860 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x8d/0x100 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x1cc/0x310 [openvswitch]\n   genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xdb/0x130\n   genl_family_rcv_msg+0x14b/0x220\n   genl_rcv_msg+0x47/0xa0\n   netlink_rcv_skb+0x53/0x100\n   genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n   netlink_unicast+0x280/0x3b0\n   netlink_sendmsg+0x1f7/0x430\n   ____sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x3a0\n   ___sys_sendmsg+0x87/0xd0\n   __sys_sendmsg+0x6d/0xd0\n   do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x2c0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nThe third issue with this process is that while trying to convert\nthe non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles\nthe size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested\nattributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling\nthem in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed\nduring the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during\nthe flow dump.\n\nIn the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are\neither validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone\nmanages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely\nnot do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are\nmixed up.\n\nFixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing\nmost of the validation code.\n\nGiven that and the fact that this functionality never worked since\nintroduction, let's just remove it altogether.  It's better to\nre-introduce it later with a proper implementation instead of trying\nto fix it in stable releases.",

The task that\nfailed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again\nand (b) putting the page back into the direct map.

The root\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to\na kernel OOPS.\n\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\n   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\n\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\n   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM\n   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\n   NULL.\n\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the\n   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\n\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,\n- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized\n  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).\n\nv4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian)",

As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL\n> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on\n> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging\n> the thread.\n\nI easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel\noops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure\nsent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based\nthis patch on.\n\nAfter xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an\nxattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns\na hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs\nused hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using\nhash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong\nhash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a\ngetattr for the xattr \"security.capability\" every time. Orangefs\nnegative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the\nxattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for\n\"security.capability\" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were\never freed.\n\nI changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead\nand the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.",

This leads\nto UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction\nsteps:\n1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module\n   to register a new device /dev/fb1;\n2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);\n3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);\n4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving\n   a wild pointer in fb_display[];\n5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode\n   from fb0.\n\nAdd a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists\nin fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.",

Therefore, the driver\ncannot assume the size of the linear data area nor fragments. Fix the\nbug in mlx5 by generating skb according to xdp_buff after XDP programs\nrun.\n\nCurrently, when handling multi-buf XDP, the mlx5 driver assumes the\nlayout of an xdp_buff to be unchanged. That is, the linear data area\ncontinues to be empty and fragments remain the same. This may cause\nthe driver to generate erroneous skb or triggering a kernel\nwarning. When an XDP program added linear data through\nbpf_xdp_adjust_head(), the linear data will be ignored as\nmlx5e_build_linear_skb() builds an skb without linear data and then\npull data from fragments to fill the linear data area. When an XDP\nprogram has shrunk the non-linear data through bpf_xdp_adjust_tail(),\nthe delta passed to __pskb_pull_tail() may exceed the actual nonlinear\ndata size and trigger the BUG_ON in it.\n\nTo fix the issue, first record the original number of fragments. If the\nnumber of fragments changes after the XDP program runs, rewind the end\nfragment pointer by the difference and recalculate the truesize. Then,\nbuild the skb with the linear data area matching the xdp_buff. Finally,\nonly pull data in if there is non-linear data and fill the linear part\nup to 256 bytes.",

Not doing\nso would result in applying the mds auth caps of\none fs on to the other fs in a multifs ceph cluster.\nThe bug causes multiple issues w.r.t user\nauthentication, following is one such example.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (on vstart cluster):\n1. Create two file systems in a cluster, say 'fsname1' and 'fsname2'\n2. Authorize read only permission to the user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname1'\n    $ceph fs authorize fsname1 client.usr / r\n3. Authorize read and write permission to the same user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname2'\n    $ceph fs authorize fsname2 client.usr / rw\n4. Update the keyring\n    $ceph auth get client.usr >> ./keyring\n\nWith above permssions for the user 'client.usr', following is the\nexpectation.\n  a. The 'client.usr' should be able to only read the contents\n     and not allowed to create or delete files on file system 'fsname1'.\n  b. The 'client.usr' should be able to read/write on file system 'fsname2'.\n\nBut, with this bug, the 'client.usr' is allowed to read/write on file\nsystem 'fsname1'. See below.\n\n5. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.usr'\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph usr@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_usr/\n6. Try creating a file on file system 'fsname1' with user 'client.usr'. This\n   should fail but passes with this bug.\n     $touch /kmnt_fsname1_usr/file1\n7. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.admin' and create a\n   file.\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph admin@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_admin\n     $echo \"data\" > /kmnt_fsname1_admin/admin_file1\n8. Try removing an existing file on file system 'fsname1' with the user\n   'client.usr'. This shoudn't succeed but succeeds with the bug.\n     $rm -f /kmnt_fsname1_usr/admin_file1\n\nFor more information, please take a look at the corresponding mds/fuse patch\nand tests added by looking into the tracker mentioned below.\n\nv2: Fix a possible null dereference in doutc\nv3: Don't store fsname from mdsmap, validate against\n    ceph_mount_options's fsname and use it\nv4: Code refactor, better warning message and\n    fix possible compiler warning\n\n[ Slava.Dubeyko: \"fsname check failed\" -> \"fsname mismatch\" ]",

The problem is that kernel page tables are modified without\nflushing corresponding TLB entries.\n\nEven if it looks like the empty flush_tlb_all() implementation on s390 is\nthe problem, it is actually a different problem: on s390 it is not allowed\nto replace an active/valid page table entry with another valid page table\nentry without the detour over an invalid entry. A direct replacement may\nlead to random crashes and/or data corruption.\n\nIn order to invalidate an entry special instructions have to be used\n(e.g. ipte or idte). Alternatively there are also special instructions\navailable which allow to replace a valid entry with a different valid\nentry (e.g. crdte or cspg).\n\nGiven that the HVO code currently does not provide the hooks to allow for\nan implementation which is compliant with the s390 architecture\nrequirements, disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP again, which is\nbasically a revert of the original patch which enabled it.",

Instead IMA hash is generated,\n\n    # getfattr -m - -d -e hex /usr/bin/bash\n    # file: usr/bin/bash\n    security.ima=0x0404...\n\nThis happens because when setting security.selinux, the IMA_DIGSIG flag\nthat had been set early was cleared. As a result, IMA hash is generated\nwhen the file is closed.\n\nSimilarly, IMA signature can be cleared on file close after removing\nsecurity xattr like security.evm or setting/removing ACL.\n\nPrevent replacing the IMA file signature with a file hash, by preventing\nthe IMA_DIGSIG flag from being reset.\n\nHere's a minimal C reproducer which sets security.selinux as the last\nstep which can also replaced by removing security.evm or setting ACL,\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <sys/xattr.h>\n    #include <fcntl.h>\n    #include <unistd.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        const char* file_path = \"/usr/sbin/test_binary\";\n        const char* hex_string = \"030204d33204490066306402304\";\n        int length = strlen(hex_string);\n        char* ima_attr_value;\n        int fd;\n\n        fd = open(file_path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0644);\n        if (fd == -1) {\n            perror(\"Error opening file\");\n            return 1;\n        }\n\n        ima_attr_value = (char*)malloc(length / 2 );\n        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < length; i += 2, j++) {\n            sscanf(hex_string + i, \"%2hhx\", &ima_attr_value[j]);\n        }\n\n        if (fsetxattr(fd, \"security.ima\", ima_attr_value, length/2, 0) == -1) {\n            perror(\"Error setting extended attribute\");\n            close(fd);\n            return 1;\n        }\n\n        const char* selinux_value= \"system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0\";\n        if (fsetxattr(fd, \"security.selinux\", selinux_value, strlen(selinux_value), 0) == -1) {\n            perror(\"Error setting extended attribute\");\n            close(fd);\n            return 1;\n        }\n\n        close(fd);\n\n        return 0;\n    }",

This results in\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\n\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\n\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\n  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\n  with giving up right away.\n\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;\nthis behavior should be fixed.\n\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\nerror code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\nir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).\n\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon: don't wedge\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon: don't parse scancodes\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\nhung task).\n\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to\nwait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds.",

This ensures that memory allocated\nfor the source strings is correctly freed on all error paths, matching\nthe cleanup already performed in the success path by\nsmb3_cleanup_fs_context_contents().\nPointers are also set to NULL after freeing to prevent potential\ndouble-free issues.\n\nThis change fixes a memory leak originally detected by syzbot. The\nleak occurred when processing Opt_source mount options if an error\nhappened after ctx->source and fc->source were successfully\nallocated but before the function completed.\n\nThe specific leak sequence was:\n1. ctx->source = smb3_fs_context_fullpath(ctx, '/') allocates memory\n2. fc->source = kstrdup(ctx->source, GFP_KERNEL) allocates more memory\n3. A subsequent error jumps to cifs_parse_mount_err\n4.

This routine initializes hardware blocks and\ntakes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a\nlarge current.\n\nThis large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is\nsupplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to\nthe regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power\nmode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework\nbecause UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if\nthe rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM\ncurrent thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this\nstate, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the\nregulator.\n\nTo prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This\nallows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active\nand in high-power mode.\n\nCurrently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is\ncompleted or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with\nQualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS vendors.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: Don't skip unrelated instruction if INT3/INTO is replaced\n\nWhen re-injecting a soft interrupt from an INT3, INT0, or (select) INTn\ninstruction, discard the exception and retry the instruction if the code\nstream is changed (e.g. by a different vCPU) between when the CPU\nexecutes the instruction and when KVM decodes the instruction to get the\nnext RIP.\n\nAs effectively predicted by commit 6ef88d6e36c2 (\"KVM: SVM: Re-inject\nINT3/INTO instead of retrying the instruction\"), failure to verify that\nthe correct INTn instruction was decoded can effectively clobber guest\nstate due to decoding the wrong instruction and thus specifying the\nwrong next RIP.\n\nThe bug most often manifests as \"Oops: int3\" panics on static branch\nchecks in Linux guests.  Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux\nuses the kernel's \"text poke\" code patching mechanism.  To modify code\nwhile other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)\nreplaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode\n0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,\nand finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code\nstream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being\nmodified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to\nhandle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is\nincorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.\n\nThe bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to\nrepeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on\nthe host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/44d17c51c28c0ac998ea0334edf90b5a\n[2]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/10e45e45afa29b11e0c7209247afc00b",

However, this does not fully solve the race, as a new\nwork item can still be scheduled *after* flush_work() completes but\nbefore the gadget's memory is freed, leading to the same use-after-free.\n\nThis patch fixes the race condition robustly by introducing a 'teardown'\nflag and a 'state_lock' spinlock to the usb_gadget struct. The flag is\nset during cleanup in usb_del_gadget() *before* calling flush_work() to\nprevent any new work from being scheduled once cleanup has commenced.\nThe scheduling site, usb_gadget_set_state(), now checks this flag under\nthe lock before queueing the work, thus safely closing the race window.",

Thus, this can\nlead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*)\ninterfaces, such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.\n\nFix the leak by zeroing the CSW data in srb's transfer buffer immediately\nafter the validation of devices that skip data phase.\n\nNote: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero-\ning pages at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB\nprotocol data is written to already-allocated sg pages.",

The fbcon\nfunction uses struct fb_info.node, which is set by register_framebuffer().\nAs the fb-helper code currently sets up VGA switcheroo before registering\nthe framebuffer, the value of node is -1 and therefore not a legal value.\nFor example, fbcon uses the value within set_con2fb_map() [1] as an index\ninto an array.\n\nMoving vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() after register_framebuffer() can\nresult in VGA switching that does not switch fbcon correctly.\n\nTherefore move vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() under fbcon_fb_registered(),\nwhich already holds the console lock. Fbdev calls fbcon_fb_registered()\nfrom within register_framebuffer(). Serializes the helper with VGA\nswitcheroo's call to fbcon_remap_all().\n\nAlthough vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() takes an instance of struct fb_info\nas parameter, it really only needs the contained fbcon state.

Even when it returns\nNULL, though, we still go on to call btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf().\n\nAs of commit e9087e828827 (\"Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for\nusb_driver_claim_interface()\"), calling btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf()\nwhen `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` is NULL will cause a crash because\nwe'll end up passing a bad pointer to device_lock(). Prior to that\ncommit we'd pass the NULL pointer directly to\nusb_driver_claim_interface() which would detect it and return an\nerror, which was handled.\n\nResolve the crash in btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() by adding a NULL check\nat the start of the function. This makes the code handle a NULL\n`btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` the same way it did before the problematic\ncommit (just with a slight change to the error message printed).",

These commands are used\nto align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.\n\nThe driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer\nposition `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.\n\nHowever, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary\n(i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`\nfunction will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`\nto be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.\n\nThis patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.\nThis ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is\nbased on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next\naligned boundary.",

The update_userdata() function iterates over the\nnt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also\niterates over this same list to count nodes.\n\nQuoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:\n> A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer\n> to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'\n> management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to\n> protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the\n> hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem\n> mutex.\n\nWithout proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed\nconcurrently while these functions are iterating, the list can be\naccessed in an inconsistent state. For example, the list_for_each() loop\ncan reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()\nwhich sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will\nnever end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).\n\nFix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all\noperations that iterate over cg_children.\nThis includes:\n- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over\n  cg_children\n- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call\n  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children\n\nThe su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid\npotential lock ordering issues, as configfs operations may already hold\nsu_mutex when calling into our code.",

Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()\ncalls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()\nreturns NET_XMIT_CN.\n\nTo ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new\nvariable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\n\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\n\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\nsome other reason.)\n\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\n\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\n\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\nand the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`\nnow only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change\nthe Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n[1] Syzbot sample crash report:\nUnexpected driver unregister!\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273 driver_unregister drivers/base/driver.c:273 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273 driver_unregister+0x90/0xb0 drivers/base/driver.c:270\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5970 Comm: syz.0.17 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 10/02/2025\nRIP: 0010:driver_unregister drivers/base/driver.c:273 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:driver_unregister+0x90/0xb0 drivers/base/driver.c:270\nCode: 48 89 ef e8 c2 e6 82 fc 48 89 df e8 3a 93 ff ff 5b 5d e9 c3 6d d9 fb e8 be 6d d9 fb 90 48 c7 c7 e0 f8 1f 8c e8 51 a2 97 fb 90 <0f> 0b 90 90 5b 5d e9 a5 6d d9 fb e8 e0 f4 41 fc eb 94 e8 d9 f4 41\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000373f9a0 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffffff8ff24720 RCX: ffffffff817b6ee8\nRDX: ffff88807c932480 RSI: ffffffff817b6ef5 RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffffffff8ff24660\nR13: dffffc0000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88814cca0000\nFS:  000055556dab1500(0000) GS:ffff8881249d9000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 000055f77f285cd0 CR3: 000000007d871000 CR4: 00000000003526f0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n comedi_device_detach_locked+0x12f/0xa50 drivers/comedi/drivers.c:207\n comedi_device_detach+0x67/0xb0 drivers/comedi/drivers.c:215\n comedi_device_attach+0x43d/0x900 drivers/comedi/drivers.c:1011\n do_devconfig_ioctl+0x1b1/0x710 drivers/comedi/comedi_fops.c:872\n comedi_unlocked_ioctl+0x165d/0x2f00 drivers/comedi/comedi_fops.c:2178\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:597 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:583 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18e/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:583\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_sys\n---truncated---",

This value includes the __GFP_FS flag, so\nallocations in that address space can recurse into filesystem memory\nreclaim.  We don't want that to happen because it can consume a\nsignificant amount of stack memory.\n\nWorse than that is that it can also deadlock: for example, in several\nplaces, gfs2_unstuff_dinode() is called inside filesystem transactions.\nThis calls filemap_grab_folio(), which can allocate a new folio, which\ncan trigger memory reclaim.  If memory reclaim recurses into the\nfilesystem and starts another transaction, a deadlock will ensue.\n\nTo fix these kinds of problems, prevent memory reclaim from recursing\ninto filesystem code by making sure that the gfp_mask of inode address\nspaces doesn't include __GFP_FS.\n\nThe \"meta\" and resource group address spaces were already using GFP_NOFS\nas their gfp_mask (which doesn't include __GFP_FS).  The default value\nof GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is less restrictive than GFP_NOFS, though.  To\navoid being overly limiting, use the default value and only knock off\nthe __GFP_FS flag.  I'm not sure if this will actually make a\ndifference, but it also shouldn't hurt.\n\nThis patch is loosely based on commit ad22c7a043c2 (\"xfs: prevent stack\noverflows from page cache allocation\").\n\nFixes xfstest generic/273.",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix racy bitfield write in btrfs_clear_space_info_full()\n\nFrom the memory-barriers.txt document regarding memory barrier ordering\nguarantees:\n\n (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often\n     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write\n     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel\n     algorithms.\n\n (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields\n     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields\n     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's\n     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one\n     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.\n\nbtrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of\nthe fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush:\n\nstruct btrfs_space_info {\n        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info;              /*     0     8 */\n        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent;               /*     8     8 */\n        ...\n        int                        clamp;                /*   172     4 */\n        unsigned int               full:1;               /*   176: 0  4 */\n        unsigned int               chunk_alloc:1;        /*   176: 1  4 */\n        unsigned int               flush:1;              /*   176: 2  4 */\n        ...\n\nTherefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to\none of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the\nbitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and\nwrites out found->full = 0 without a lock.\n\nImagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we\nfinished deleting a block_group and are thus calling\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim\nticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space():\n\n          T1                                             T2\nbtrfs_commit_transaction\n  btrfs_clear_space_info_full\n  data_sinfo->full = 0\n  READ: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)\n                                              spin_lock(&space_info->lock);\n                                              if(list_empty(tickets))\n                                                space_info->flush = 0;\n                                                READ: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n                                                MOD/WRITE: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:0\n                                                spin_unlock(&space_info->lock);\n                                                return;\n  MOD/WRITE: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n\nand now data_sinfo->flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This\nbreaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or\nrunning. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go\ninto __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info->tickets but will\nsee space_info->flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,\nthey will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible\nto kick the worker again.\n\nI also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that\nit is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,\nthe assembly is:\n  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)\nand similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0:\n  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)\n\nSo I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed\na number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to\nreproduce it.\n\nRather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take\nadvantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that\nit is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to\nbools. This avoids writes to space_info->full having any effect on\n---truncated---",

                            "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix double free of qgroup record after failure to add delayed ref head\n\nIn the previous code it was possible to incur into a double kfree()\nscenario when calling add_delayed_ref_head(). This could happen if the\nrecord was reported to already exist in the\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error\nlater on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since\nadd_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the\nrecord. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer\nto NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object\nwhich was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the\nobject is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the\nfix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of\nthe add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()\nthe given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to\nact on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the\n'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the\ntracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'\nboolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object\nonly if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the\ntracing logic.\n\nAs a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that\n'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the\nfunction, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert\nhappens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid\nvalue on an early exit.\n\nThe documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated\nto reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object.",

GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.\n\nWe get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting\ngso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense\nthat this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due\nto the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy\nthrough setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific\nassumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further\ninto the GSO engine in the first place.\n\nThe checks were added in 121d57af308d (\"gso: validate gso_type in GSO\nhandlers\") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine\na protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such\npackets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via\nnetif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs\ncould be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be\nan additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case.

This could lead to\ninconsistent access results, potential access right widening, and\nhard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot be printed.\n\nFor a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to\nhave write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to\nthe underlying source of the bind mount, and read access to the related\nmount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access\nrights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to\ninconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be\ninherited from the mount point hierarchy, while inheriting permissions\nfrom the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.\n\nLandlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected\ndirectories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the\nmount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also always taking\ninto account the mount point from which these disconnected directories\nwere opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would\nwiden access rights [1].\n\nThe rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be\nvisible or accessible to a sandboxed task, relying on the collected\naccess rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will\nnot be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison\nbetween the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).\nIt may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and\ndirectories, but the security policies are always enforced for all the\nevaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to\nusers and safer from an access control perspective.\n\nRemove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and\nfix the related comment.\n\nBecause opened files have their access rights stored in the related file\nsecurity properties, there is no impact for disconnected or unlinked\nfiles.",

When the number of attached queues\ndrops to 1 blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() need to mark both the tagset and\nthe remaining queues as unshared.\n\nBoth functions need to freeze current queues in tagset before setting on\nunsetting BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED flag. While doing so, both functions\nhold set->tag_list_lock mutex, which makes sense as we do not want\nqueues to be added or deleted in the process. This used to work fine\nuntil commit 98d81f0df70c (\"nvme: use blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset\")\nmade the nvme driver quiesce tagset instead of quiscing individual\nqueues. blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() does the job and quiesce the queues in\nset->tag_list while holding set->tag_list_lock also.\n\nThis results in deadlock between two threads with these stacktraces:\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? timerqueue_add+0x66/0xb0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  schedule_preempt_disabled+0xa/0x10\n  __mutex_lock.constprop.0+0x271/0x600\n  blk_mq_quiesce_tagset+0x25/0xc0\n  nvme_dev_disable+0x9c/0x250\n  nvme_timeout+0x1fc/0x520\n  blk_mq_handle_expired+0x5c/0x90\n  bt_iter+0x7e/0x90\n  blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter+0x27e/0x550\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x1c0/0x210\n  blk_mq_timeout_work+0x12d/0x170\n  process_one_work+0x12e/0x2d0\n  worker_thread+0x288/0x3a0\n  ? rescuer_thread+0x480/0x480\n  kthread+0xb8/0xe0\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? xas_find+0x161/0x1a0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x3d/0x70\n  ? destroy_sched_domains_rcu+0x30/0x30\n  blk_mq_update_tag_set_shared+0x44/0x80\n  blk_mq_exit_queue+0x141/0x150\n  del_gendisk+0x25a/0x2d0\n  nvme_ns_remove+0xc9/0x170\n  nvme_remove_namespaces+0xc7/0x100\n  nvme_remove+0x62/0x150\n  pci_device_remove+0x23/0x60\n  device_release_driver_internal+0x159/0x200\n  unbind_store+0x99/0xa0\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x112/0x1e0\n  vfs_write+0x2b1/0x3d0\n  ksys_write+0x4e/0xb0\n  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x160\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe top stacktrace is showing nvme_timeout() called to handle nvme\ncommand timeout. timeout handler is trying to disable the controller and\nas a first step, it needs to blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() to tell blk-mq not\nto call queue callback handlers. The thread is stuck waiting for\nset->tag_list_lock as it tries to walk the queues in set->tag_list.\n\nThe lock is held by the second thread in the bottom stack which is\nwaiting for one of queues to be frozen. The queue usage counter will\ndrop to zero after nvme_timeout() finishes, and this will not happen\nbecause the thread will wait for this mutex forever.\n\nGiven that [un]quiescing queue is an operation that does not need to\nsleep, update blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() to use RCU instead of taking\nset->tag_list_lock, update blk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() to use RCU\nsafe list operations. Also, delete INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->tag_set_list)\nin blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() because we can not re-initialize it while\nthe list is being traversed under RCU. The deleted queue will not be\nadded/deleted to/from a tagset and it will be freed in blk_free_queue()\nafter the end of RCU grace period.",

It creates instead a link where the\nsupplier is the parent of the expected device.\n\nOne consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.\n\nIssues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree\noverlay:\n\n    // An LED driver chip\n    pca9632@62 {\n        compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";\n        reg = <0x62>;\n\n\t// ...\n\n        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {\n            reg = <3>;\n            label = \"addon:led:pwm\";\n        };\n    };\n\n    backlight-addon {\n        compatible = \"led-backlight\";\n        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;\n        brightness-levels = <255>;\n        default-brightness-level = <255>;\n    };\n\nIn this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\n(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier).

NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported",

This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to invoking\nptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.\nThis ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the\ncheck, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of\ncredentials.",

If 'index' > 0, 'vstl' writes\nat least 2 bytes.\n\nclang generates kmsan write helper call depending on inline assembly\nconstraints. Constraints are evaluated compile-time, but value of\n'index' argument is known only at runtime.\n\nclang currently generates call to __msan_instrument_asm_store with 1 byte\nas size.

                            "Description": "When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706.\nNote that upgrading pip to a \"fixed\" version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by using a Python version that implements PEP 706.\n\nNote that this is a vulnerability in pip's fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706\nand therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're using a Python version that implements PEP 706\nthen pip doesn't use the \"vulnerable\" fallback code.\n\nMitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python >=3.9.17, >=3.10.12, >=3.11.4, or >=3.12),\napplying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice.",
